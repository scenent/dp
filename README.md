# dp
 A small 2D physics engine.

# Features
- Basic Rigidbody implementations including force, velocity, torque, angular velocity
- Several useful algorithm implementation for physics simulation (collision detection, triangulation, convex hull)
- Collision Detection & Collision Response via SAT(Separated Axis Theorem) algorithm
- Easy intergration system with game engine

# TODO
- Implement restitution
- Implement collision for perfect circle shape

# Renderer for demo projects
